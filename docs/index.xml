      <description>Ultimate is a non-contact, self-refereed team sport played with a flying disc. Ultimate brings together elements of soccer, american football, and basketball to create a dynamic, action-packed, high-intensity game that requires a high degree of speed, endurance, skill, and most importantly, teamwork.
A game of ultimate is played by two teams with a flying disc on a pitch with end zones, similar to an american football pitch but narrower. The object of the game is to score by catching a pass in the opponent’s end zone.</description>

      <description>Ultimate is a non-contact, self-refereed team sport played with a flying disc (or Frisbee™). Two teams of seven players compete on a rectangular pitch. At each end of the pitch there is an end zone. Each team defends one endzone. They score a goal if one of their players catches the disc in the opposite end zone. The player with the disc is called the thrower and may not run with the disc.</description>

      <description>Spirit of the Game is one of the core elements in flying disc sports. It is similar to fair play and sportsmanship, but there is a much higher emphasis put on it in Ultimate and it is one of the defining aspects of the sport. Spirit of the Game places the responsibility of fair play solely on the players by requiring each player to know the rules and make their own calls, without the help of a referee.</description>
