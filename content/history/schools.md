Galway ultimate community members have introduced ultimate to a number of city schools over the years including Coláiste Éinde, Coáiste Iognáid, and Calasanctius College.

Galway's first schools team to compete at a tournament was Calasanctius College who competed at the 2016 All Ireland Schools competition. The team was coached by Tribe members Eoin Breen and Cormac Shields who played for Tribe's predecessor Snach at the time. Current Tribe U24 captain Shane Monaghan got his first taste of ultimate on this team.
