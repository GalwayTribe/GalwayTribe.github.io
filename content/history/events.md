Galway Open took place in 2010 and 2011.
Galway hosted Indoor Nationals in 2019.
NUIG has hosted lots of IVs events over the years in all divisions. Women's Indoors 2020, Mixed Indoors 2018 and Open Indoors 2016 are the most recent for each division I believe.
Tribe hosted Smugairle RÃ³in an indoor beginner tournament (twice I think)
Galway has hosted an annual charity Christmas hat tournament since 2013.
