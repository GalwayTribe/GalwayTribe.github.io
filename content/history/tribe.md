Tribe was established in 2016 when members of Snatch voted overwhelmingly in favour of a motion propsed by Eoghan Staunton at the Snatch AGM to rebrand club ultimate in Galway.  

The club and its new look was launched onto the scene that year, making its debut in the Open Division at Yes But Nau and the Women's Division at Munster Munch. Those outings were followed up by Tribe's debut in the  Mixed Division at Windmill in 2017.

Since then the club has gone from strength to strength, running tournaments, beginner programs, charity events and competing all over Ireland and further afield. The club is known for its spirited ultimate and inclusive nature, you can read more about the club [here](/about).
