Galway\'s first club team Snatch was formed in 2011 by Galway and Limerick based players looking to play at a higher level than was possible on their university teams. Galway and Limerick Stalwarts such as Eoin Wallace, Liam Grant, James Moore and Liam Anderson were the driving forces behind the club's formation. 

The club debuted in its distincive yellow and black in the Open Division at the All Ireland Ultimate Championships in 2011. In 2012 the club won its first silverware, taking home the plate and the Spirit award at the the All Ireland Indoor Ultimate Championships.

The club debuted in the Mixed Division at the All Ireland Ultimate Championships 2012, finishing a respectable 6th despite playing the last few games with only 3 female matching players. 

By summer 2012 the Galway and Limerick communities had enough plaers to support teams of their own. The Limerick contingent formed a new club, [PELT](https://www.facebook.com/PeltUltimate/), which has gone on to become a major force on the European scene winning multiple Irish titles. 

Snatch continued as a Galway team becoming known for its grit and spirit until 2016 when members made the decision to relaunch Galway club ultimate under a new identity [Tribe](www.tribeultimate.github.io). The yellow and black team does reappear from time to time, especially at Irish Beach Nationals.
