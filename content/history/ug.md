The first ultimate team in Galway was the National University of Ireland, Galway team. Back in 2005 Thomas O’Rourke founded the NUIG Panteras, named after Las Panteras de Xalapa, an Ultimate team from Mexico from whom Thomas learned the sport. 

The team grew slowly at first driven on by players like Eoin Wallace, Luke Watson & Paddy Costello. In the early years the team trained on the President’s Lawn in front of the beautiful quadrangle at the heart of the college campus. The small team had some great successes while heading to tournaments with barely a full line of 7, often leaning on the talents of semester students from North America. 

The team really began to grow its Irish player base in 2010. Led by Liam Grant, who you may know from his commentary work, with support from current Tribe mixed captain Eoghan Staunton the club did everything it could to persuade, convince and cajole the student population to give the sport a try and to stay. Liam's company, Lahinch Surf Rentals, became the team's first kit sponsor and the club began to host the Galway Open a party tournament with a division focused on newer players. The club began to compete in indoor tournaments and tournaments abroad, while Thursady night parties became legendary.

The university, now known as University of Galway, now has a thriving ultimate team that competes in Mixed, Women's and Open tournaments. Students from the other university in Galway, Atlantic Technical University, may also join the University of Galway team.  The club acts as one of the main sources for Tribe player recruitment.
