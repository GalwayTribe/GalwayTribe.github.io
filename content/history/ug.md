The first ultimate team in Galway was the Naional University of Ireland, Galway team. Back in 2005 Thomas O’Rourke founded the NUIG Panteras, named after Las Panteras de Xalapa, an Ultimate team from Mexico from whom Thomas learned the sport. Slowly the team grew with support from players like Eoin Wallace, Luke Watson & Paddy Costello. The team trained on ‘the President’s Lawn’ a lovely patch of grass at the heart of the college campus. 

The university, now known as University of Galway has a thriving ultimate team that competes in Mixed, Women's and Open tournaments. Students from the other university in Galway, Atlantic Technical University, may also join the University of Galway team.
