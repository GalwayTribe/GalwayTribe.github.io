Ultimate is a non-contact, self-refereed team sport played with a flying disc (or Frisbee™). Two teams of seven players compete on a rectangular pitch. At each end of the pitch there is an end zone. Each team defends one endzone. They score a goal if one of their players catches the disc in the opposite end zone. The player with the disc is called the thrower and may not run with the disc. Instead they move the disc by passing to team-mates in any direction. The defensive team gets possession of the disc if an offensive team’s throw is not caught by a player of the same team. Then the defensive team becomes the offensive team and can try to score in the opposite end zone. 

<h3>THE BASIC RULES</h3>

**The Pitch:** Rectangular in shape with end zones at each end. A regulation pitch is 100m long and 37m wide, with end zones 18m deep.

**The Pull:** Each point begins with both teams lining up on the front of their respective end zone line. The defense throws ("pulls") the disc to the offense.

**Scoring:** Each time the offense completes a pass in the defense's end zone, the offense scores a point. Play is initiated with a pull by the scoring team after each score.

**Movement of the Disc:** The disc may be advanced in any direction by completing a pass to a teammate. Players may not run with the disc. The person with the disc ("thrower") has ten seconds to throw the disc. The defender guarding the thrower ("marker") counts out the stall count.

**Change of Possession:** When a pass is not completed (e.g. out of bounds, drop, block, interception, stalled), the defense immediately takes possession of the disc and becomes the offense.

**Substitutions:** Players not in the game may replace players in the game after a score and during an injury timeout. An unlimited amount of substitutions can be made during the course of a game.

**Non-contact:** No physical contact is allowed between players. Picks and screens are also prohibited. A foul occurs when contact is made.

**Fouls:** When a player initiates contact on another player a foul occurs. When a foul disrupts possession, the play resumes as if the possession was retained. If the player committing the foul disagrees with the foul call, the play is redone.

**Self-Officiating:** Players are responsible for their own foul and line calls. Players resolve their own disputes.

**Spirit of the Game:** Ultimate stresses sportsmanship and fair play. Competitive play is encouraged, but never at the expense of respect between players, adherence to the rules, and the basic joy of play.
