Spirit of the Game is one of the core elements in flying disc sports. It is similar to fair play and sportsmanship, but there is a much higher emphasis put on it in Ultimate and it is one of the defining aspects of the sport. Spirit of the Game places the responsibility of fair play solely on the players by requiring each player to know the rules and make their own calls, without the help of a referee. This reinforces mutual respect and trust between opponents; communication and conflict resolution skills; and self confidence â€“ both on and off the pitch.

Spirit of the Game is summarised in this preamble to the WFDF rules of play as follows: *All players are responsible for administering and adhering to the rules. Ultimate relies upon a Spirit of the Game that places the responsibility for fair play on every player. It is trusted that no player will intentionally break the rules; thus there are no harsh penalties for breaches, but rather a method for resuming play in a manner which simulates what would most likely have occurred had there been no breach. Highly competitive play is encouraged, but should never sacrifice the mutual respect between players, adherence to the agreed-upon rules of the game, or the basic joy of play.*

<h3>5 PILLARS</h3>

**Rules Knowldge and Use:**
Players are expected to know and follow the rules, show a willingness to learn when in doubt and not to use rules to their own advantage.

**Avoiding Fouls and Body Contact:**
Player safety is paramount. Players should avoid fouling, intentional contact and dangerous plays.

**Positive Attitude:**
The pure and simple joy of ultimate is at the heart of the sport.

**Fair-mindedness:**
Spirit of the Game emphasizes a different take on sports.  Instead of promoting a win-at-all-costs mentality, Spirit expects players not to take advantage of, or knowingly break the rules.

**Communication and Respect:**
Whenever there is disagreement about a call, players are expected to resolve the dispute on their own. Players need to calmly express their perspective while actively listening to different perspectives and engaging in efficient discussion about calls.
