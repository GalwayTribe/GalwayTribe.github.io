Tribe was established in 2016 and is now the premier club team in Galway. Tribe made its debut in the Open Division at Yes But Nau and the Women's Division at Munster Munch that year. Tribe's first outing in the Mixed Division was at Windmill 2017. Since those humble beginnings the club has gone on to be one of the most active clubs in Irish Ultimate, sending teams to indoor and outdoor events across the country in all three divisions. The growth of Ultimate in the west is down to the hard work of many and the building and development of a tight knit and supportive community.
