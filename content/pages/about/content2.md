Galway is well known in Ireland and further afield as *the City of Tribes*. This is a reference to the the fourteen merchant families who once dominated Galway as de facto rulers. Between the mid-13th and late 19th centuries Galway became an important European trading port under their influence. 

The power and influence of these families took a severe blow when Cromwell's forces laid siege to Galway for almost a year, starting in 1651. When the city surrendered in 1652, Cromwell confiscated all property belonging to the Tribes. Cromwell was the man who first called the families the *Tribes of Galway* as a derogatory name. The families countered this by proudly adopting it as a mark of defiance.

After the Cromwell era, the Tribes briefly enjoyed a return to power of sorts but suffered another defeat in the War of the Two Kings in 1691, where they sided with the Jacobites who wanted tolerance for Catholicism and Irish autonomy. By the 19th century, the once-great tribes were all but gone from the city.

The 14 families of the Galway tribes came from diverse backgrounds including Irish, Norse, French, English, Welsh, and various combinations of some or all of the above. We are one Tribe representing, and open to, all of Galway's diverse modern-day tribes.
