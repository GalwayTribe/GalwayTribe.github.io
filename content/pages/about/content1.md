Tribe was established in the summer of 2016 to represent Galway on the club ultimate scene. Tribe made its debut in the Open Division at Yes But Nau and the Women's Division at Munster Munch that year. The club's first outing in the Mixed Division was at Windmill 2017.

Since then the club and its distinctive jellyfish kit has become a fixture at tournaments all across the country in all three divisions, outdoors, indoors and on the beach. 

Tribe is one of the most active clubs in Irish Ultimate, with around 60 active members and regular trainings, pickup and non-ultimate events. 

Outdoor trainings are usually held in the University of Galway's Dangan Sportsgrounds or in Laurel Park. Indoor trainings are usually held in the Knocknacarra Community Centre or the Salerno Sportsdome. You can find an interactive map of these venues and other Tribe venues on our [contact](/contact) page.

Tribe prides itself on the tight knit, supportive and inclusive community it has built and welcomes anyone to join.
