Tribe players love to trade their kit and our light kit, adorned by Tribe's colourful jellyfish logo can be seen being worn by players all over the wold who have traded with us.

But why choose a jellyfish to represent Galway? 

Ireland is not known for its fearsome wild animals. Many of the animals that one might choose; the wolf, the giant Irish deer, the brown bear or the golden eagle have all unfortunately become extinct here.  However, those of us who have spent years swimming in the cold Atlantic waters of the Galway coast can attest to the persistence, endurance, and stings of our native jellyfish. Barrel, Blue, Moon, Compass and Lion's Mane jellyfish all call our waters home while the Portuguese Man O'War has also been known to visit.
