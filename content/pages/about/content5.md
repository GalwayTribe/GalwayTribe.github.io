Tribe always looks to make a positive impact on the world beyond ultimate. Every year the club organises a charity Christmas tournament, which has raised thousands of euros for charities such as the Simon Community, the Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland, and Hometree over the years. 

In 2021/2022 Tribe focused on sustainability, organising beach clean ups, reducing car use, food waste, meat consumption, and plastic consumption while donating to organisations fighting climate change and biodiversity loss. 

In 2020 Tribe took part in the UK and Ireland Ultimate Black Lives Matter Fundraising Challenge, raising awareness, educating and donating to the Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland and Sport Against Racism Ireland.
