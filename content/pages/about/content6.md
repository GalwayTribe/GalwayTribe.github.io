As a club, Tribe builds on a Galway's proud ultimate history and strives to make some of its own. Ultimate first came to Galway in 2005 in the form of the university team NUI Galway Panteras.  The university team was named after a similarly named team in Mexico, where Panteras founder Thomas O'Rourke was first introduced to ultimate. 

In 2011 Galway's first club team, Snatch, was formed to represent Galway and Limerick. It was from this club that Tribe was eventually born in 2016.
