Galway is well known in Ireland and further afield as *the City of Tribes*. This is reference to the the fourteen merchant families who once dominated Galway between the mid-13th and late 19th centuries. Galway became an important European trading port during these times. However, this all came to an end during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland when the families were forced to surrender their properties. It was Cromwell’s forces that referred to them as “The Tribes of Galway” in attempt to belittle them, but in an act of rebellion and defiance the merchant families adopted the name.
