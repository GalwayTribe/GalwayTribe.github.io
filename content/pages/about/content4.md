Our dark kit features an image of *Gaillimh* or *Galvia*, the mythylogical princess for whom it is said Galway is named. Gaillimh was the beautiful daughter of the mythical chief of the *Fir Bolg*, Breasal, who drowned near a great rock in the river according to a mid-17th century map of the town. Both the city *Cathair na Gaillimhe* and the river that flows through its heart *Abhainn na Gaillimhe* were named for her. However, the river is no longer called the *Gaillimh*, instead it is named *Abhainn na Coirribe* after the lake from which it flows.

The kit also features a Galway hooker, a tradional local fishing boat, navigating the river. The boat which features three maroon sails was designed to weather the strong seas off the west coast of Ireland. It has become a symbol of the city and is depicted on the coat of arms of Galway. Galway hookers are still being constructed to this day and the festival of *Cruinniú na mBád* is held each year, when boats race across Galway Bay from Connemara to Kinvara.
